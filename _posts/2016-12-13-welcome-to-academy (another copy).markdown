<p>Hi! Anand here from the team at Academy Furniture and Supplies. I hope to keep you informed with tidbits from Howard, Dimitri, Todd, Matt, and the rest of the team to help keep you up to date on current developments. 
We have our [current website][AcademyFurniture] under development. We won't be able to see any changes within the next few weeks, but know that they are coming!</p>
